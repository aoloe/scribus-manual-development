## Not (yet) a programmer

If you're not (yet)a programmer, you might be puzzled because of many new concepts in this manual.

Let's try to get some of them straight:

- You don't need to program for contributing to the Scribus project.
- Being able to compile the Scribus code is not a requirement, but it will be very helpful in the long term.
- If you have questions, get into our irc channel, our forums and/or our mailing list.

# Getting the code

## Using SVN

You can get the code from the Scribus own Subversion repository

```bash
svn co svn://scribus.net/trunk/Scribus scribus
```


## Using Git

You can get the code from one of the community maintained mirrors:

- From the Github mirror:  
  `git clone git@github.com:scribusproject/scribus.git` or  
  `git clone https://github.com/scribusproject/scribus.git`
- From the Gitlab mirror:   
  `git clone git@gitlab.com:scribus/scribus.git` or  
  `git clone https://gitlab.com/scribus/scribus.git`

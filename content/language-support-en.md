# Language support

Dictionaries and hyphenation files are taken from the Libreoffice project.

You can see the list of avaialble language packs: <https://cgit.freedesktop.org/libreoffice/dictionaries/plain/>.

Many of them are conversion from Latex packages.

If you want to add support for a new language in Scribus you should prefer to directly add it for Libreoffice.

Sadly, at the time of writing, the Scribus project has not the skills and knowledge to help you in this process.  
The best _next step_ is probably to get in touch with the maintainer (or the team) of a Libreoffice package for a language similar to the one you want to be supported (a similar language might have similar rules, be from the same geographic region, or have a similar size / typology of users).

Currently, it seems that the number of supported languages is much smaller than the number of languages that have localisation for the user interface: it is possible that the effort for creating the support for new language is rather big.

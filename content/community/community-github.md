No, the core devs are only using the SVN. When any PRs are submitted to the Scribus Github mirror one of the volunteers will make a submission to Scribus bugtracker. It's not efficient or ideal but it's a way to have a presence on Github.

all this has been discussed lot of times.
if the team wants to switch to git or github they will make a sign, don't worry.
in my eyes, the only thing that can help, is having an healthy crew of contributors here on github so that they get a figure of what they are missing.
at this point, words won't be of any help... they are comfortable with their svn workflow and don't have any need  to switch.
you see a reason to switch, but are not (yet) contributing any code...
i see a reason to switch, but they know that i can keep on working with svn as i've done in the past :-) (and i don't contribute much code either)
if one day we will have a few regular contributors that are on github and are pissed off by the over complicated workflow, we restart the discussion!
for now, i'd prefer to mention this idiosyncrasy but at the same time we should  try not to give too much weight to it.

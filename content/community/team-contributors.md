- there is a Scribus team and it's a well defined group of people. that's the official Scribus.
- there is a Scribus community which is a more variable group of people. some of the people in the community have been committing lot of time to scribus over many years. others are (or have been) giving lot of contributions for a limited time with much dedication and are not in them. some have been much involved in scribus for many years and are not in the team.

currently, three members of the team are also sometimes defined as "the core developers", regularly squashing bugs and managing the patches that are proposed. i would avoid that term on the scribus.io site.
